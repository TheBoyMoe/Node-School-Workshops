### Higher Order Functions

A higher-order function does at least one of the following:
 * take one or more functions as an input,
 * return a function
 
All other functions are 1st order functions. In js all functions are first class functions, they can be treated as values and so can be passed to other functions as arguments and assigned to variables or properties on objects.
